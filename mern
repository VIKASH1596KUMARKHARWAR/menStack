a component can only return a single top lever xml. why?? 

ans. make it easier for reconciliation

explaination:: In React, a component can only return a single top-level XML (or JSX) element because it simplifies the rendering process and makes reconciliation (React's diffing algorithm) more efficient.

React requires a single top-level element to:

	1. Easily Compare Trees: React compares old and new versions of the UI efficiently when thereâ€™s a single root.
	2. Reduce Complexity: Managing one root element keeps the rendering process clean and avoids ambiguity.
If you need multiple elements, wrap them in a parent element like a <div> or React Fragment (<>...</>). This keeps the structure simple for React.
