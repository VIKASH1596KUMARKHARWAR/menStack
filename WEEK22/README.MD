## Summary Table

| **Application**             | **Scaling Techniques**                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Video Transcoding**       | - **Horizontal Scaling** (Scaling out servers for transcoding tasks).                                  |
|                             | - **Parallel Processing** (Splitting videos into chunks and processing concurrently).                  |
|                             | - **Content Delivery Networks (CDN)** for video caching and delivery.                                  |
|                             | - **Cloud Resource Elastic Scaling** (AWS, Google Cloud for dynamic resource allocation).              |
|                             | - **Edge Processing** to reduce latency for users.                                                    |
|                             | - **GPU Acceleration** for faster transcoding (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs).                                     |
| **Online Chess Platforms**  | - **Horizontal Scaling** with Load Balancers for concurrent games.                                     |
|                             | - **Real-time Communication** using WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO).                                      |
|                             | - **In-Memory Caching** for game states and leaderboards (e.g., Redis).                                |
|                             | - **Database Sharding** for scaling user and game data.                                               |
|                             | - **Cloud-Based Infrastructure** for elastic scaling and fault tolerance.                             |
| **Digital Payments (Paytm)**| - **Microservices Architecture** to split and scale services independently.                            |
|                             | - **Horizontal Scaling** with Load Balancers for massive concurrent requests.                         |
|                             | - **Database Sharding and Replication** for transaction consistency.                                  |
|                             | - **Caching** for frequently accessed data (e.g., Redis/Memcached).                                    |
|                             | - **Message Queues** for handling asynchronous tasks (e.g., Kafka/RabbitMQ).                          |
|                             | - **Elastic Cloud Scaling** (AWS Auto-Scaling, Kubernetes).                                           |
|                             | - **High Availability and Security** through redundancy, encryption, and real-time fraud detection.   |

## Key Takeaways:
1. **Horizontal Scaling** is the backbone for handling large-scale applications across all domains.
2. **Real-time systems** (e.g., Chess platforms) leverage WebSockets and caching for low-latency responses.
3. **Video Transcoding** depends on **parallel processing** and GPU-accelerated servers.
4. **Digital Payments Platforms** focus on reliability, fault tolerance, and scalability using microservices and cloud-based auto-scaling.
5. **Caching** and **Sharding** ensure fast access to critical data while distributing workloads efficiently.
