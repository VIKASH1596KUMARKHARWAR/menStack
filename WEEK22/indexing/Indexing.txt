Indexing 
An index is a data structure that allows the database to find and access specific rows in a table quickly, without scanning the entire table.

Think of it like the index at the end of a book, which helps you locate specific topics quickly instead of reading through every page.

When you create an index on a field, a new data structure (usually B-tree) is created that stores the mapping from the index column to the location of the record in the original table. 
Search on the index is usually log(n) 


docker run  -p 5434:5434 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres
docker exec -it container_id /bin/bash
psql -U postgres


| **Index Type**          | **Description**                                                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Index**       | Automatically created for the **Primary Key**. Ensures unique, sorted entries.                   |
| **Unique Index**        | Ensures all values in a column are unique (no duplicates).                                       |
| **Clustered Index**     | Sorts the rows of a table based on the index. Each table can have only one clustered index.       |
| **Non-Clustered Index** | A separate structure that points to the rows in a table. Multiple non-clustered indexes can exist.|
| **Composite Index**     | An index on **multiple columns** to optimize queries involving those columns.                    |
| **Full-Text Index**     | Used for searching text-based data, useful for large text fields.                                |
| **Hash Index**          | Uses a hash table for faster equality-based lookups (e.g., exact matches).                       |
| **B-Tree Index**        | Default index type in most RDBMS. Balanced tree for ordered data and range-based queries.        |
| **Bitmap Index**        | Efficient for columns with low cardinality (few unique values, e.g., gender, status flags).      |
